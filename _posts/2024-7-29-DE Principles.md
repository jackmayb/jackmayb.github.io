title: Detection Engineering Principles
---
Detection engineering is a crucial aspect of cybersecurity, focusing on designing and implementing effective methods for identifying security threats. Here are some key principles and practices of effective detection engineering based on the provided sources:

●
Focus on Threat Intelligence: Threat intelligence (TI) plays a vital role in effective detection engineering. Sources highlight that the most helpful TI is specific, actionable, and relevant to an organization's IT environment. Instead of generic reports, TI should provide detailed descriptions of adversary behaviors, including specific techniques, procedures, and indicators of compromise. This information enables detection engineers to develop targeted detections and prioritize their efforts effectively.

●
Prioritize the Detection Backlog: Managing the detection engineering backlog is critical. A prioritized backlog ensures that resources are allocated to the most critical threats. Sources suggest a priority-based system, with the highest priority given to known target techniques with minimal coverage and the lowest priority assigned to operational metrics and KPIs.

●
Address Detection Coverage and Cost: Finding a balance between comprehensive attack surface coverage and the associated costs is crucial. Each detection deployed comes with costs related to false positives, maintenance, and resource consumption. Detection engineers should strive for comprehensive detections that cover multiple attack stages instead of numerous low-impact detections.

●
Consider Failure Modes: Sources outline potential failure modes related to threat detection and intelligence. These include failures in observability, utilization, analysis, and action. Understanding these failure modes helps detection engineers design robust detection mechanisms and response strategies.

●
Leverage Threat Modeling: Effective detection engineering relies heavily on threat modeling. By analyzing potential attack paths and adversary tactics, detection engineers can identify critical assets, potential vulnerabilities, and develop detections that target specific adversary behaviors.

●
Foster Cross-Functional Collaboration: Detection engineering benefits significantly from collaboration with other security functions, such as threat intelligence and threat hunting. Threat hunting activities provide valuable input into the detection backlog by identifying gaps in existing detections and uncovering new adversary techniques.

●
Incorporate Context and Correlation: Sources emphasize the importance of context and correlation in detection engineering. Analyzing behaviors in isolation may not provide sufficient signal for detection. By correlating outputs from multiple analytics, detection engineers can achieve higher fidelity detections and reduce false positives.

●
Continuous Improvement: Detection engineering is an iterative process requiring continuous improvement. Sources advocate for establishing clear processes for detection content lifecycle management. This includes regular reviews and updates to existing detections based on new threat intelligence, feedback from incident response, and changes in the IT environment.

By adhering to these principles and incorporating the practices outlined in the sources, organizations can enhance their threat detection capabilities and improve their overall security posture.
