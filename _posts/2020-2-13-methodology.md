### 1. Discovery Phase

The foundation of any thorough penetration test begins with discovery. During this phase:

- Map network's footprint to understand its scope and boundaries
- Conduct various scans (ICMP, TCP, UDP) to identify live systems
- Determine which systems are responding and accessible
- Build a comprehensive picture of network environment

This phase is crucial as it establishes our testing baseline and helps define the attack surface for subsequent phases.

### 2. Enumeration/Target Profiling Phase

Once it's understood what's available on the network, dig deeper to identify:

- Operating system types and versions
- Open ports and listening services
- Virtual hosts that may be present
- Web applications and management consoles
- Software versions through "banner grabbing"
- Technology stacks in use (PHP, Tomcat, etc.)
- SMB configurations, including version information and file shares
- Potential configuration issues
- Default files that might expose information

This detailed cataloging helps to understand the technologies in your environment and how they interact.

### 3. Vulnerability Identification Phase

With a clear picture of the environment, begin identifying potential security gaps:

- Deploy automated vulnerability scanning tools appropriate for the technology stack
- Perform manual testing of common vulnerabilities
- Analyze application logic to determine normal behavior and potential deviations
- Cross-reference software versions against known vulnerability databases
- Identify weaknesses in services (telnet, unencrypted HTTP logins, SSL issues)
- Classify systems and identify attack vectors based on collected data
- Validate findings to eliminate false positives

This phase combines automated tools with human expertise to ensure comprehensive coverage while minimizing false positives.

### 4. Attack Scenario Phase

This is where theory is put into practice:

- Exploit identified vulnerabilities to determine their actual severity
- Leverage known or logical vulnerabilities to attempt access to systems or data
- Validate whether theoretical vulnerabilities pose real-world risks
- Identify sensitive information that might be exposed
- Gather additional knowledge that could inform other attack vectors

Important notes on attack approach:
- No denial of service (DoS) attacks
- Avoid any exploits that could be detrimental to services
- For high-risk vulnerabilities, will consult before proceeding
- Immediately notify of any critical vulnerabilities that could lead to imminent compromise

### 5. Post-Exploitation Phase

If we successfully gain access to systems:

- Utilize discovered information from previous successful attacks
- Determine if compromised systems can be leveraged to attack other hosts
- Pivot to other systems where possible
- Expand access to demonstrate the potential impact
- Search for sensitive information such as credentials, intellectual property, payment card data, health information, or other valuable assets

This phase demonstrates the real-world impact of security gaps and helps prioritize remediation efforts.

### 6. Reporting Phase

Finally, document findings:

- Gather all information and evidence into a comprehensive report
- Provide clear explanations of vulnerabilities discovered
- Detail the potential business impact of each issue
- Offer specific, actionable remediation recommendations
- Present findings in business-friendly language while including technical details

Reports are designed to be valuable for both executive stakeholders and technical teams responsible for implementing fixes.

Throughout the testing process, maintain regular communication with team and adhere to the agreed-upon scope. For any critical findings that could represent an immediate risk, notify immediately rather than waiting for the final report.

Before beginning any engagement, work to understand:
- Any third-party sites that might be in scope
- Notification requirements and key contacts
- IPS/IDS systems that may need to be adjusted
- Specific goals and what is hoped to be achieved through the penetration test
